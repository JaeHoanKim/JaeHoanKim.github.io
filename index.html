Hello!<br/>
I am an undergraduate student in Seoul National University. <br/>

My Current interest lies at the intersection of <strong>mathematical statistics (estimation theory, nonparametric Statistics, and probability theory), High-dimensional Data 
Analysis, and machine learning</strong> <br/>
 

Outside of statistics, I enjoy playing futsal, climbing, and doing workouts. <br/>
