<br/>
I'm a graduate student in Texas A&M University. My research interest lies in providing mathematical background and justification in statistical methodologies in various fields. I double-majored in Mechanical engineering and Statistics and graduated with honors <i> (Summa cum laude)</i>. <br/><br/> 
 
Outside of statistics, I enjoy playing futsal, climbing, and doing workouts. <br/><br/>
