Hello!<br/><br/>
I am an undergraduate student in Seoul National University. My current interest lies at the intersection of <strong>mathematical statistics (<em>estimation theory, 
    nonparametric statistics, and asymptotic theory</em>), 
    high-dimensional data analysis, and machine learning.</strong> I am also interested in <strong>interdisciplinary projects</strong>. <br/><br/> 
 

Outside of statistics, I enjoy playing futsal, climbing, and doing workouts. <br/><br/>
