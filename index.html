Hello!
<br/><br/>
I'm a graduate student in Texas A&M University. My research interest lies in providing mathematical background and justification in statistical methodologies in various fields. I double-majored in Mechanical engineering and Statistics and graduated with honors <em> (Summa cum laude)</em> from Seoul National University (SNU). <br/><br/> 
 
Outside of statistics, I enjoy playing climbing, futsal, and doing workouts. <br/><br/>

Feel free to email me at k1mjh6561 (at) tamu (dot) edu.
