I am an undergraduate student in Seoul National University (SNU). 

My Current interest lies at the intersection of <em>mathematical statistics (estimation theory, nonparametric Statistics, and probability theory), High-dimensional Data 
Analysis, and machine learning</em>


Outside of statistics, I enjoy playing futsal, climbing, and doing workouts.
