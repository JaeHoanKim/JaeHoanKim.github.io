Hello!<br/><br/>
I am an undergraduate student in Seoul National University. <br/><br/>

My Current interest lies at the intersection of <strong>mathematical statistics (<em>estimation theory, nonparametric Statistics, and probability theory</em>), High-dimensional Data 
Analysis, and machine learning.</strong> <br/><br/>
 

Outside of statistics, I enjoy playing futsal, climbing, and doing workouts. <br/><br/>
