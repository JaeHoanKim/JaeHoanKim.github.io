Hello!

<br/><br/>
<img src="assets/face_2022_11.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" id="hp"/>
I'm a graduate student at Texas A&M University in the Department of Statistics. After a year at Texas A&M, I'm transferring to Duke University starting in 2023 Fall. My previous/current research is about the approximation in the Gaussian Process and High dimensional linear discriminant rules. My research interest lies in providing mathematical background and justification in statistical methodologies in various fields. I am eager to learn and research new topics, including theoretical approaches in machine learning, information theory, and mixing time in Markov Chains.


<br/><br/>
I double-majored in Mechanical engineering and Statistics and graduated with honors <em> (Summa cum laude)</em> from Seoul National University (SNU).  <br/><br/> 
 
Outside of statistics, I enjoy <a href=https://jaehoankim.github.io/miscellanies/>indoor climbing</a>, futsal, and doing workouts. <br/><br/>

Feel free to email me at k1mjh6561 (at) tamu (dot) edu.
