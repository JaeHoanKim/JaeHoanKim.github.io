Hello!

<br/><br/>
<img src="assets/face_2022_11.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" id="hp"/>
I'm a graduate student at <b>Duke University</b> in the Department of Statistical Science. After completing my first year as a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University, I transferred to Duke from 2023 Fall semester. My research interest includes Robust Bayesian approach under model misspecification, scalable Gaussian process with theoretical justification and its application. I am eager to learn and research new topics, including theoretical approaches in machine learning, information theory.

<br/><br/>
I double-majored in Mechanical engineering and Statistics and graduated with honors <em> (Summa cum laude)</em> from Seoul National University (SNU).  <br/><br/> 
 
Outside of statistics, I enjoy <a href=https://jaehoankim.github.io/miscellanies/>indoor climbing</a>, futsal, and doing workouts. <br/><br/>

Feel free to email me at jaehoan (dot) kim (at) duke (dot) edu.
