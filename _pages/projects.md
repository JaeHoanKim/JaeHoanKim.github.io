<li><b>Rpackage - MVToep</b>, <em>Faster Multivariate Gaussian sampling under Toeplitz covariance</em></li>

<ul>

<li>Improve the sampling speed of multivariate normal distribution using fast Fourier transform (FFT), referring to the algorithm from <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1390903#metadata_info_tab_contents">[Wood and Chan (1994)]</a></li>

<li>Currently under developing <a href = "https://github.com/JaeHoanKim/MVToep">[Github]</a></li>

   </ul>

<li><b>Analysis on COVID-19 government policies (social distancing) in Korea </b></li>

<ul>

<li>Investigated the validity of COVID-19 government policies, especially the social distancing in Korea</li>

<li>Split the confirmed cases into group infection and individual infection by crawling the data from KDCA (Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency)</li>

<li>fitted the AR-GARCH model and VAR model to analyze the interaction between the two types of infection and performed the change-point analysis <a href = "https://jaehoankim.github.io/assets/TSA_final_Korean.pdf">[final report (written in Korean)]</a></li>

</ul>

<li><b>KBrainLab</b>, <em>a startup provided a Korean lottery number recommendation service</em></li>

<ul>

<li>Developed a lottery number recommendation algorithm using graph theory that improved the expected value of the customers by 9%, ensuring 100% of winning the high--rank lottery in a group aspect</li>

<li>Substantiated the effectiveness of the algorithm with nonparametric testing methods</li>

<li>Took an initiative of founding as a Chief Technical Officer / Co-founder</li>

</ul>

<li><b>Fluid dynamic analysis of ping-pong ball trajectory</b>, <em>thesis paper in Mechanical engineering, SNU</em></li>
   <ul>
   <li> Achieved 10X accuracy in trajectory prediction by considering the lift force and Drag force in tandem with the gravity </li><a href = "https://jaehoankim.github.io/assets/Thesis_JaehoanKim.pdf">[Thesis paper (written in Korean)]</a></li>
   
   
   <li> Extracted the position of ping-pong ball and angular velocity by image processing <a href = "https://github.com/JaeHoanKim/Pingpong_analysis">[Github]</a></li>
   </ul>

<li><b>AI Tech Play</b>, <em> AI education brand initially funded by Knowledge AI (KAIT) Foundation based in Boston</em></li>

<ul>

<li>Led the Technology Team to deliver free AI education to 200+ middle school students struck by COVID-19</li>

<li>Created a coding education booklet based on the autonomous RACECAR code materials from <b>MIT Lincoln Lab</b>.</li>

<li>Uploaded a video with detailed explanation about tasks in the booklet. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utCzjtSN9Pk&t=700s">[Link]</a></li>

<li>

<b>Xcorps</b>, <em>Practical Issue Research Contest, Seoul National University</em>

<ul>

<li>Established a drone-based automated survivor detection system in a fire scene using a path-planning algorithm</li>

<li>Devised a signal detection algorithm using the variance after a fast Fourier transform and improved the filtration accuracy significantly <a href = "https://jaehoankim.github.io/assets/images/xcorps_img.PNG">[Signal detection scheme]</a></li>
